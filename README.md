## INF 442

INF442 is a course on data analysis I attended during spring 2024. It covers the basis of data analysis such as k-d tree search, clustering with k-means, hierarchical clustering, supervised learning and k-NN prediction, linear models for regression and for classification, feature extraction and a bit about MLP.

## Computer Vision project

The computer vision project is a project I did with anither student. The goal of the project is to remove a person from an image and to inpaint the background. My personnal contribution to this project is the design of the pipeline and the implementation of some of the models used both for the mask extraction and for inpainting. For this project we submitted a jupyter notebook file, a project report, some slides and a quick video showcasing our program.

## Tumor identification

This is a homework I was assigned to do in a deep learning class. The goal is to train a model to differentiate healthy and sick images.
